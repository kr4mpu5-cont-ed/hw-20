                <p>My passion is creating digital products that are useful to real people. Products that help people accomplish meaningful tasks as they go about their daily lives. Products that remove friction at every step along the way. I have been both an engineer and a leader of engineering teams to bring technology solutions to life, marrying my love of tech with my passion for building useful products.</p>
